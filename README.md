Project Description

An AI-powered app that checks if your Sadhya is arranged correctly on a banana leaf ‚Äî because, of course, that matters more than taste.
The Problem (that doesn't exist)

People are eating Sadhya chaotic style ‚Äî avial near the banana, payasam on the left, and pappadam chilling in the middle like it's the DJ. This is an existential threat to Onam aesthetics.
The Solution (that nobody asked for)

We trained an AI model to analyze banana leaf symmetry and judge your Sadhya plate. It tells you if your Vishu vibe is off or if you're ready for the culinary catwalk.
